The acompanying dataset has been obtained from a phosphoproteomics experiment that was performed to analyze (3 + 3) PDX models of two different subtypes using Phosphopeptide enriched samples.
LC-MS analysis of 2 technical duplicates has been performed on each sample.
The results set consisted of Normalized abundances of MS signals for ca. 1400 phosphopeptides
Goal of the analysis: **search phosphopeptides that allow differentiation of the two tumor groups*
This should be made with both Statistical Analysis and visualization.
Data have been provided as an excel file: TIO2+PTYR-human-MSS+MSIvsPD.XLSX

Groups are defined as:
- MSS group: Samples M1, M5 and T49,
- PD group: Samples M42, M43 and M64 with two technical replicates for each sample
The first column, *SequenceModification* contains abundance values for the distinct phosphopetides. Other columns can be omitted.
