# metaboData

# Introduction

A repository with a few public metabolomics datasets borrowed from different public open sources.

While we don't come out with a better option the repository will be "folder-based". That is:

- Each dataset is contained in a folder named with a short-descriptive name with no spaces and no special codes.
- Each folder contains a "description.md" document, written in markdown with information about the dataset.
- Eventually a template will be provided to fuill the description.

The root directory contains a comma separated file with information on data (one dataset per row) and the following columns:
- Folder_name
- Creation_Date
- Created_by
- Content_description
